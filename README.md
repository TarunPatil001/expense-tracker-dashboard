## 🧮 Mathematical Concepts & Algorithms

### **1. Budget Calculation Mathematics**

#### **Daily Budget Calculation** *(Implemented)*
```
Daily Budget = Monthly Budget ÷ Days in Month
Remaining Daily Budget = (Monthly Budget - Total Spent) ÷ Days Remaining
Current Daily Average = Total Expenses ÷ Current Day
```

#### **Budget Status Analysis** *(Implemented)*
```
Budget Used = Sum of All Expenses
Budget Remaining = Monthly Budget - Budget Used
Overspend Amount = Max(0, Budget Used - (Daily Budget × Current Day))
```

### **2. Smart Budget Rebalancing Algorithms** *(Implemented)*

#### **Adaptive Daily Limit Reduction**
```
New Daily Limit = Max(Budget Remaining ÷ Days Remaining, 0)
Reduction Percentage = ((Original Daily Limit - New Daily Limit) ÷ Original Daily Limit) × 100
Feasibility Check = New Daily Limit ≥ Original Daily Limit × 0.3
```

#### **Weekly Budget Rebalancing**
```
Weeks Remaining = Ceiling(Days Remaining ÷ 7)
Weekly Budget = Budget Remaining ÷ Weeks Remaining
```

#### **Overspend Recovery Calculations**
```
Daily Earn Target = Overspend Amount ÷ Days Remaining
Weekly Recovery Target = Overspend Amount ÷ Weeks Remaining
```

### **3. Transaction Analytics** *(Implemented)*

#### **Current Month Filtering**
```
Current Month Transactions = Filter by Month && Year
Monthly Income = Sum(Income Transactions)
Monthly Expenses = Sum(Expense Transactions)
Monthly Balance = Monthly Income - Monthly Expenses
```

#### **Daily Expense Aggregation**
```
Daily Expenses = Group transactions by date and sum amounts
Running Total = Cumulative sum of daily expenses
```

### **4. Category Analysis** *(Basic Implementation)*

#### **Category Totals**
```
Category Total = Sum of transactions per category
Category Percentage = (Category Total ÷ Total Expenses) × 100
```

#### **Productive Category Identification** *(Implemented)*
- Categories: Education, Health, Investment, Skill Development, Books, Courses
- Used for rebalancing strategy recommendations

## 📊 Data Processing Algorithms

### **Current Month Analytics Calculation**
```javascript
// Filter transactions for current month only
const currentMonthTransactions = transactions.filter(transaction => {
  const transactionDate = new Date(transaction.date)
  return transactionDate.getMonth() === currentMonth && 
         transactionDate.getFullYear() === currentYear
})
```

### **Smart Budget Strategies Implementation**
- **Strategy 1**: Reduce daily spending limits based on remaining budget
- **Strategy 2**: Weekly budget distribution for flexibility
- **Strategy 3**: Redirect overspend to productive categories
- **Strategy 4**: Income generation to offset budget overrun

## 🔢 Mathematical Validation

### **Feasibility Checks** *(Implemented)*
- Daily limit reduction cannot exceed 70% of original budget
- Weekly budgets must be positive values
- Overspend calculations use Max(0, value) to prevent negative values

### **Data Integrity** *(Implemented)*
- Transaction date validation for current month filtering
- Amount validation for calculations
- Category existence checks for productive investment strategy
